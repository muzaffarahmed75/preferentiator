## Preferentiator
This tool helps you rank a list of items you wish to sort manually.

### Quickstart
Python is required to run this. Write the items you wish to sort in a text file in the same folder, separated by newlines.  
Install Python and run via:  
`python main.py <filename>`

### Efficiency
Merge sort is quite close to the sort with minimum number of comparisons. The average case of merge sort is pretty good and it will be optimized further in future updates.
